## JavaScript Modules

There are two different types of JavaScript modules:

1. CommonJS modules, which are used in Node.js. They use `require()` to import and `module.exports` to export. The file extension for CommonJS modules is typically `.js` or `.cjs`.

2. ES6 modules, which are part of the ECMAScript 2015 standard. They use `import` and `export` statements. The extension for ES6 modules is typically `.mjs` or `.js` (when using the `type="module"` field in `package.json`).

## NPM application setup

- use `npm init` to create a `package.json` file for your project.

## Version Numbering

Version numbers in npm follow the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** version is incremented when there are major changes that break backward compatibility.
- **MINOR** version is incremented when new features are added in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version is incremented when backward-compatible bug fixes are made.
